Multi Threading
Bank withdrawal by two individuals.
Overdraw if thread safety is not taken into account
Thread safe version to demonstrate the measures to protect the account
integrity.

Account Class:
    Name

    Balance=1000 (Current_Balance)

    Withdraw (Deducts amount from balance)

    AccountOverdrawDemo with main method and demonstrate
    that if two threads (indicating two joint account holders
    with separate ATM cards) access the Account class at the
    same time and try to make withdrawal (call withdraw method)
    at the same time, account will overdraw at one point if both
    account holders keep withdrawing at the same time.

    AccountOverdrawSafeDemo-You need to clearly demonstrate that
    both threads are accessing the same account at the same time
    and thread safety measures keep the account from overdrawing.

System.out.println - Will demonstrate various information about Threads
