Step one-
Ask user to select from 7 shapes
0 Circle
1 Rectangle
2 Triangle
3 Square
4 Sphere
5 Cylinder
6 Cuboid
7 Cube
SAMPLE INPUT OUTPUT
[
    (Assume Circle Selected)
    Enter radius : 2
    Area of the Circle with radius 34 is :
    Circumference of the Circle with radius 34 is :

    (Assume Square Selected)
    Enter side : 3
    Area of the Square with side 3 is : <value>
    Perimeter of the Square with side 3 is : <value>
]
On 1 selection
1 Ask radius
area=pi*r*r
perimeter=2*pi*r
error on radius zero

On 2 Selection
1 ask length, breadth
area=l*b
perimeter=2*(l+b)
error on length or breadth zero

On 3 Selection
1 ask base,height for area
ask length of three sides for perimeter
area=(b*h)/2
perimeter= l1+l2+l3
error on base, height=0
error on l1+l2<=l3 or l2+l3<=l1 or l1+l2<=l2

On 4 Selection
1 ask length of side
area=l*l
perimeter=4*l
error on l=0

On 5 Selection
1 ask radius
area=(4/3)*pi*r*r*r
Surface area=4*pi*r*r
error on r=0

On 6 selection
1 ask base radius, height
area=pi*r*r*h
surface area=2*pir*r*h +2*pi*r*R

On 7 selection
1 ask side length
volume=a*a*a
surface area=6*a*a

On 8 selection
1 ask l,b,h
volume=l*b*h
surface area=2*(l*b+b*h+l*h)
