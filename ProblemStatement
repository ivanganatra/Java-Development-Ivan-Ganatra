Problem Statement - 2
Write a program that accepts user inputs as follows and perform certain operations and displays the results on the console. The program must keep running and must not exit.

The program is supposed to ask the shape (Circle, Reactange, etc) and calculate the area, perimeter and volume (if the shape selected is 3-D) and display the result. The program should make a pre-configured menu and display on the console on start up to present the various shape choices to the users
Depending on the shape entered by the user, the program must ask additional questions/input parameters from the user. For example, if Circle is entered, it must ask for the radius (r). If Triangle is entered, the program must ask for base (b) and height (h).
Again, use appropriate terminology for the shape in question. Distinguish between when to calculate what - Area, Circumference, Volume, Perimeter.
Once all information is entered, display the result to the user on the console.

Notes
Follow appropriate OOPs design principles to design this program.
Proper exception handling should be done. For example, one can refer to the following page : https://convincedcoder.com/2018/12/22/Exception-handling-best-practices-Java/
Dedicated Exception classes must be created and thrown.

Example
Select the shape to calculate area and perimeters for :
Circle
Rectangle
Triangle
Square
Sphere
Cylinder
Etc

(Assume Circle Selected)
Enter radius : 2
Area of the Circle with radius 34 is :
Circumference of the Circle with radius 34 is :

(Assume Square Selected)
Enter side : 3
Area of the Square with side 3 is : <value>
Perimeter of the Square with side 3 is : <value>
