Problem Statement - 1

Write a program to count words in web page content.

Inputs:
List of URLs (select your own URLs for testing) provided in a text file, e.g. urls.txt
List of words (select your own words for testing) provided in a text file, e.g. words.txt
Place the files above in such a way that the reviewer can himself get your code and just run without having to alter the source code to adjust the path. In other words, don’t use a hardcoded path particular to your machine, instead derive the path.
Outputs:
 For each URL, print:
the top 3 words on the given list
the number of occurrences of each word
List the words sorted by the number of occurrences in descending order.
For each word on the given list, print the total number of occurrences across all the specified URLs. List the words sorted by the total number in descending order.
